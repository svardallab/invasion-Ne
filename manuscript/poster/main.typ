        #v(0.5cm)
        - Biological invasions are a major threat to biodiversity but also can be viewed as large-scale, unplanned experiments on how populations adapt to novel environments.
        - Accurate estimates of recent effective population size ($N_e$) can guide conservation management plans and help disentangle the effects of selection and demography on genetic variation.
        - Existing methods to infer very recent effective population size are not well-suited for realistic invasion scenarios.
      ],
      #pop.column-box(heading: "Theoretical framework")[
        #v(0.5cm)
        We propose a method to infer recent evolution in $N_e$ that can incorporate relevant prior information of the invasion process and the source population.

      #pop.column-box(heading: "Modelling multiple introductions")[
      #v(0.5cm)
      Multiple introductions are common in biological invasions, although difficult to model. In order to accommodate them, we leveraged recent advances in inhomogeneous phase-type distributions to compute approximate likelihoods.

         Preliminary results suggest we can estimate the migration rate $m$ from LD data of the focal population solely. However, the posterior distribution for all other parameters is highly multimodal and raises concerns about identifiability.

    #v(0.5cm)
      The proposed method works better than existing state-of-the-art methods, at least in part because it does not penalize an abrupt change in $N_e$ at the beginning of the invasion.
